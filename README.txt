This is my submission for project 3 of the final sprint.

It is similar to my assignment, with a couple of differences:

1. I added a dollar amount to inventory, adding another kind of data to my JSON.
2. I've replaced code with functions, to demonstrate my ability to create and invoke functions
3. I've added one more detail to the report; the total cost of inventory. It is displayed in the console. 

In addition, there is a function that formats the dollar amount so they display correctly

This will be both avaliable on github (https://github.com/NLScotty/SD9_FinalSprint_ScottNormore), and through
the teams "pass in assignment" area.
